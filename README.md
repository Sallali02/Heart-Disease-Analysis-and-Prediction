# Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project analyzes and cleans data from the UCI Heart Disease repository, using 14 key attributes to uncover patterns. It then builds machine learning models to predict heart disease likelihood and classify its severity (1-4). The goal is to aid early diagnosis and deepen understanding of heart disease.
